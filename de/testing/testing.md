- DFT Rules
	- Rule1: self-initialization or initialize from tester
	- Rule2: disable internal clocks during test
		- disable on-chip PLL in test mode
		- enable external clock from tester
	- Rule3: 
	- Rule4: 
- Internal Scan
	- Scan chain insertion (aka. DFT insertion or DFT synthesis) in early 1970's \[Williams 73\]\[Eichelberger 77\]
- External Scan
