- hw deep sleep mode power down sequence
	- at active status
	- at wait status
	- clock
		- when power down, disable clock
		- when power up, enable clock
	- iso_en
		- when power down, assert iso_en
		- when power up, deassert iso_en
	- ret_en (retention)
		- when power down, assert ret_en
		- when power up, deassert ret_en
	- resetn
		- when power down, assert resetn
		- when power up , deassert resetn
	- power
		- when power down, assert power-gate signal
		- when power up, deassert power-gate signal
	- at deep sleep status
	- PS: hw deep sleep mode power up sequence 就是反過來操作
- hw light sleep mode power down sequence
	- at active status
	- at wait status
	- disable clock
	- at deep sleep status
	- PS: hw light sleep mode power up sequence 就是反過來操作
